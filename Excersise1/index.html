              Behind this platform is a two-person team of fourth-year
              Informatics university students who built InfoHub as part of a
              course assignment, with the goal of creating something genuinely
              useful for fellow students. We designed the site around real study
              needs we face ourselves — clear structure, reliable resources, and
              easy navigation between courses, books, and video materials. While
              the project began as an academic task, we treated it like a real
              learning product: organized by topic, focused on practical skills,
              and built to support studying, revision, and steady progress.
